# Symmetric-VCL
Exploring Symmetric Measures for Variational Inference in Continual Learning

This work was produced as a final assessement for the course *Uncertainty in Deep Learning*, as part of the completion of the MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford. 

A comprehensive write-up, following the NeurIPS conference paper format, is available in this repository alongside the relevant implementation.

## Code for the base implementation of the paper was in part borrowed from and inspired by:
